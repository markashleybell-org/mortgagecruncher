This code was extracted from the [ExcelFinancialFunctions](https://github.com/fsprojects/ExcelFinancialFunctions) library, because there is currently no [package release](https://www.nuget.org/packages/ExcelFinancialFunctions) which is compatible with .NET Core 3.1 (see https://github.com/fsprojects/ExcelFinancialFunctions/issues/9 ). 

No modifications have been made to the code itself, but the original project contains a full test suite which hasn't been copied over.

I'll remove this and resume using the original library if/when a compatible package is released (or I can find time to make a pull request myself).
